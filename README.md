# SF HS Sync POC

## Use Case
W.P Supplies would like to have their Salesforce records synced to HubSpot. The following are in scope of the  sync requirement:
* (SF) Accounts > HS (Companies) (One way from SF)  
* (SF) Contacts > HS (Contacts) (One way from SF)  
* Contact and accounts that are associated to each other in Salesforce, should also be associated in HubSpot 
* W.P perform checks against the companies they do business with in order to do credit checks using Creditsafe. A HS workflow will be utilized to implement this requirement
